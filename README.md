# Lucene-Program
Lucene Indexing and Searching Tool

This Java program leverages Apache Lucene to build and query a search index for a collection of JSON-formatted articles. The articles are read from a specified file, and their titles and abstracts are indexed for efficient searching. The tool provides a command-line interface for querying the index, allowing users to input search queries and retrieve relevant documents. Boost values can be configured to prioritize certain fields during the search process. The program is designed to be versatile and customizable, making it a useful resource for information retrieval tasks.

The program has been tested on, aproximately, 100000 articles from PubMed Central.
